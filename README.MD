The line `Obin's Computer: hey hey` is printed first because the `println!("Obin's Computer: hey hey");` statement is executed immediately in the main function, while the `println!("Obin's Computer: howdy!");` and `println!("Obin's Computer: done!");` statements are inside an asynchronous task that is spawned to run concurrently.
